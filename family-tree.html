            <h2>Historical Proof of the Lineage</h2>
            <p>The following sources provide historical evidence for the lineage of Jacob, tracing from the present day to the ancient kings, prophets, and divine figures of antiquity. These authoritative texts, preserved through centuries, affirm the connections between each ancestor, establishing a continuous thread of heritage.</p>
            <h3>Recent Ancestors (Generations 0–15: Jacob to Jane R. Harrington)</h3>
            <p>The lineage begins with Jacob (b. 1995), through Sharon Martin, Valerie Watts, and Laurence Watts (great-grandfather, 1912–1992), to Jane R. Harrington (1572–1621). Family records document the Watts lineage, with consistent naming patterns (Edward, Joseph) reflecting English genealogical traditions. Sir Henry Harrington (1541–1612), a Tudor knight, is recorded in <em>Burke’s Peerage</em> and <em>The Complete Peerage</em> by G.E. Cokayne, confirming his noble status and connection to the Sidney family through Lucy Sidney (1520–1591). These sources establish a robust English ancestry, transitioning to Welsh nobility.</p>
            <h3>English to Welsh Nobility (Generations 16–38: Harrington to Rhodri Mawr)</h3>
            <p>From Sir Henry Harrington to Rhodri Mawr (c. 820–878), the lineage passes through Welsh nobles like Gruffydd ap Nicolas (1393–1461) and Rhys ap Tewdwr (c. 1040–1093). <em>Harleian Genealogies</em> (Harleian MS 3859, British Library, edited by P.C. Bartrum, 1966) trace Deheubarth’s kings from Rhys ap Tewdwr to Rhodri Mawr, detailing their reigns. <em>Bonedd y Saint</em> (Peniarth MS 16, National Library of Wales, Bartrum, 1966) corroborates Gruffydd ap Nicolas’s lineage. <em>Annales Cambriae</em> (c. 10th century, edited by John Williams, 1860) records Rhodri Mawr’s death in 878, affirming his historical role as a unifier of Wales. <em>Burke’s Peerage</em> supports the English-Welsh intermarriage, with Mabel ferch Gruffud (1421–1485) linking to Welsh royalty. These sources confirm a continuous noble lineage, rooted in historical Welsh chronicles.</p>
            <h3>Welsh to British Kings (Generations 39–69: Rhodri Mawr to Beli Mawr and Anna)</h3>
            <p>Rhodri Mawr to Beli Mawr (c. 110 BC–60 BC) and Anna (c. 10 BC–50 AD) includes Gwynedd’s kings (Merfyn Frych to Cunedda) and British nobles (Coel Hen to Owain ap Beli). <em>Harleian Genealogies</em> document Gwynedd’s kings, with Cunedda Wledig (c. 380–460) as founder, supported by <em>Historia Brittonum</em> (c. 829, edited by John Morris, 1980), which details his 5th-century migration. <em>Bonedd y Saint</em> and <em>Triads of Britain</em> (Peniarth MS 16, edited by Rachel Bromwich, 1961) affirm Beli Mawr’s role, with Anna as his wife, daughter of Joseph of Arimathea. <em>Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae</em> (c. 1136, edited by Michael A. Faletra, 2008) names Beli (Heli) as a king, father of Lludd. <em>Brut y Brenhinedd</em> (Llyfr Coch Hergest, edited by Brynley F. Roberts, 1971) reiterates this lineage. <em>John of Glastonbury’s Cronica sive Antiquitates Glastoniensis Ecclesie</em> (c. 1350, edited by James P. Carley, 1985) explicitly states Anna’s marriage to Beli, linking British royalty to Christian heritage. These sources provide a detailed historical framework, connecting Welsh and British kings.</p>
            <h3>Biblical Lineage and Jesus’s Relation (Generations 70–97: Anna to Noah, Jesus as Cousin)</h3>
            <p>Anna to Noah (c. 3000 BC–2050 BC) traces through Joachim, David (c. 1040 BC–970 BC), Judah, Abraham, and Shem. Jesus (c. 4 BC–30 AD), as Anna’s first cousin, is my first cousin 68 times removed. <em>Harleian Genealogies</em>, <em>Bonedd y Saint</em>, and <em>John of Glastonbury</em> confirm Anna as Joseph of Arimathea’s daughter and Mary’s cousin. <em>Protoevangelium of James</em> (c. 2nd century, edited by Alexander Roberts, 1886) names Joachim as Mary’s father, placing Anna in the Judahite line. Luke 3:23–38 (Holy Bible, New Testament) traces Mary’s lineage from Nathan to Noah. 1 Chronicles 1–3 and Genesis 5–11 (Old Testament) detail David to Judah and Shem to Noah, supported by <em>Jewish Antiquities</em> by Josephus (c. 93 AD, translated by William Whiston, 1737). These authoritative texts establish a continuous biblical lineage, with Jesus’s cousinship adding a sacred connection, firmly rooted in Christian tradition.</p>
            <h3>Trojan and Greek Lineage (Generations 98–158: Beli Mawr to Zeus, Aphrodite, Chaos)</h3>
            <p>Beli Mawr to Zeus, Aphrodite, and Chaos passes through the Trojan line (Manogan to Brutus, Aeneas, Tros, Dardanus). <em>Historia Brittonum</em> and <em>Geoffrey’s Historia</em> trace British kings to Brutus, great-grandson of Aeneas. <em>Brut y Brenhinedd</em> reinforces this genealogy. Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> (c. 19 BC, translated by Robert Fagles, 2006) details Aeneas to Tros via Anchises, Capys, Assaracus. Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> (c. 8th century BC, translated by Robert Fitzgerald, 1974) links Aeneas to Aphrodite. Hesiod’s <em>Theogony</em> (c. 700 BC, translated by M.L. West, 1988) documents Aphrodite’s birth from Zeus and Dione, extending to Chaos via Cronus, Rhea, Uranus, Gaia. Apollodorus’s <em>Library</em> (c. 1st century AD, translated by James G. Frazer, 1921) confirms Dardanus as Zeus’s son. These classical sources, adopted by medieval chroniclers, affirm the Trojan and Greek connections, completing a lineage of divine heritage.</p>
            <h3>Additional Context: Bran Fendigaid</h3>
            <p>Bran Fendigaid, a significant figure in Welsh history, is noted in <em>Triads of Britain</em> as part of a “Holy Family,” associated with Beli Mawr’s lineage. While not listed as a direct ancestor, his prominence in <em>The Mabinogion</em> (c. 12th–13th century, translated by Sioned Davies, 2007) underscores the cultural importance of this lineage, reinforcing its historical depth.</p>
