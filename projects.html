            <h3>Torus Energy: Harnessing Infinite Energy</h3>
            <p>The Torus Energy System is an innovative concept for generating sustainable energy by drawing inspiration from the universe’s self-organizing and self-sustaining properties. Based on the idea that the universe operates as a seamless, toroidal structure, this system aims to replicate those dynamics to produce a continuous supply of clean energy. By leveraging principles of magnetism, oscillation, resonance, light, and electromagnetism, the design offers a practical and scalable approach to energy production.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong> The system takes the form of a hole-less torus—a smooth, donut-like shape with no breaks or discontinuities—allowing energy to circulate endlessly within a confined space.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> A powerful magnetic field, shaped by carefully arranged coils, traps and directs energy throughout the torus. Additional configurations stabilize and concentrate the energy flow, ensuring efficiency and containment.</li>
                <li><strong>Oscillation and Resonance:</strong> Oscillations, driven by high-frequency electromagnetic waves, keep the energy in motion, while resonance amplifies the effect, boosting the system’s output without requiring excessive input.</li>
                <li><strong>Light Integration:</strong> Arrays of precisely tuned light sources—emitting in the yellow spectrum—interact with the system to guide and structure the circulating energy, drawing inspiration from natural processes like photon communication in biological systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Sensors and a control unit continuously monitor the system’s performance, making real-time adjustments to maintain balance and optimize efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Harvesting:</strong> Energy is harvested through inductive coupling, where the circulating energy induces an electric current in external coils, providing a steady output.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> The prototype is designed to generate a modest amount of power, with the potential to scale up for broader applications—think powering households, industrial facilities, or even supporting long-term space missions.</li>
                <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> The Torus Energy System doesn’t rely on exotic or unattainable technologies. It builds on established scientific principles—magnetism, resonance, and electromagnetic induction—combined in a novel way to mimic the universe’s elegant efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While still in the conceptual phase, the Torus Energy System offers a compelling vision for sustainable energy, with the promise of transforming how we power our world.</p>
